# BDO-Ontology

This ontology models the information available in the Ovidian Digital Library. The Ovidian Digital Library is the result of a series of research projects of the same title, funded by the Ministries of Science and Technology, Science and Innovation, and Economy and Competitiveness, which have been carried out at the University of Santiago de Compostela since 2007. The information has been extracted from the detailed study of the copies of the illustrated editions of Ovid from the 15th to the 19th century, which are curated in Spanish libraries, both public and private. The ontology models the different entities, their attributes and relationships. An important feature is the integration of a series of thesauri to represent the values of certain properties and which are in the process of being developed. The ontology is under development and undergoing successive refinements.
